//What are generator functions?

//ntroduced in the ES6 version, generator functions are a special class of functions.

//They can be stopped midway and then continue from where they had stopped.

//Generator functions are declared with the function* keyword instead of the normal function keyword:

function* genFunc() {
    // Perform operation
}

//In normal functions, we use the return keyword to return a value and as soon as the return statement gets executed, the function execution stops:

function normalFunc() {
    return 22;
    console.log(2); // This line of code does not get executed
}

//In the case of generator functions, when called, they do not execute the code, instead, they return a generator object. This generator object handles the execution.
function* genFunc() {
    yield 3;
    yield 4;
}
genFunc(); // Returns Object [Generator] {}

//The generator object consists of a method called next(), this method when called, executes the code until the nearest yield statement, and returns the yield value.

//For example, if we run the next() method on the above code:
genFunc().next(); // Returns {value: 3, done:false}

//As one can see the next method returns an object consisting of a value and done properties.  Value property represents the yielded value. Done property tells us whether the function code is finished or not. (Returns true if finished).

//Generator functions are used to return iterators. Let’s see an example where an iterator is returned:

function* iteratorFunc() {
    let count = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
        count++;
        yield i;
    }
    return count;
}

let iterator = iteratorFunc();
console.log(iterator.next()); // {value:0,done:false}
console.log(iterator.next()); // {value:1,done:false}
console.log(iterator.next()); // {value:2,done:true}

//As you can see in the code above, the last line returns done:true, since the code reaches the return statement.
